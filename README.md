<H3> Running Tests </H3>

To ensure the correctness of the Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation, unit tests are provided. These tests cover various aspects of the game logic, including player interactions, move validation, and win conditions.

Steps:

>Save the code: Save the code for the TicTacToeGame class, Player class, HumanPlayer class, BotPlayer class, and check_winner function in a file named logic.py.

>Create a test file: Create a new file named test.py.

>Import necessary modules: Import the necessary modules in the test.py file, including unittest and logic.

>Define test cases: Define test cases for each function in the TicTacToeGame class and the check_winner function. Use the unittest module to create test cases.

>Run the test file: Save the test.py file and run it from the command line using the following command:

*Bash : python test.py*
