Running Tests

To ensure the correctness of the Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation, unit tests are provided. These tests cover various aspects of the game logic, including player interactions, move validation, and win conditions.

Steps:

Save the code: Save the code for the TicTacToeGame class, Player class, HumanPlayer class, BotPlayer class, and check_winner function in a file named logic.py.

Create a test file: Create a new file named test_logic.py.

Import necessary modules: Import the necessary modules in the test_logic.py file, including unittest and logic.

Define test cases: Define test cases for each function in the TicTacToeGame class and the check_winner function. Use the unittest module to create test cases.

Run the test file: Save the test_logic.py file and run it from the command line using the following command:

Bash
python test_logic.py
